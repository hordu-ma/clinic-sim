# Change DB Model

Use this skill for model and migration changes.

## Execute Workflow

1. Read `references/migration-workflow.md`.
2. Update model definitions in `src/apps/api/models`.
3. Create or edit Alembic migration under `src/apps/api/migrations/versions`.
4. Ensure route/schema/service code is aligned with new fields.
5. Validate migration upgrade and downgrade logic locally.
6. Update tests for new constraints and behavior.

## Guardrails

- Do not ship model changes without migration scripts.
- Do not rely on implicit defaults when data compatibility matters.
- Do not run automatic migration in production startup flow.
