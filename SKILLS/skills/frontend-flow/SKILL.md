# Frontend Flow

Use this skill for Vue page-flow changes and route behavior updates.

## Execute Workflow

1. Read `references/flow-map.md`.
2. Locate impacted views and router entries.
3. Update page logic in `src/apps/web/src/views`.
4. Keep auth checks consistent in `src/apps/web/src/router/index.ts` and user store.
5. Route all non-stream API calls through `src/apps/web/src/api/request.ts` wrappers.
6. Validate mobile view behavior and main user journey.

## Guardrails

- Keep navigation behavior deterministic for unauthenticated users.
- Avoid duplicated request/error handling paths across components.
- Preserve existing visual language unless task explicitly requests redesign.
