# Security Check

Use this skill for change-time security checks.

## Execute Workflow

1. Read `references/security-checklist.md`.
2. Verify secret handling in code, compose files, and docs.
3. Check auth and permission paths for changed endpoints.
4. Confirm production-safe defaults for docs, debug, and migration behavior.
5. Flag risks and required follow-up actions with file references.

## Guardrails

- Never allow committed `.env` files.
- Never keep weak JWT defaults in production settings.
- Require explicit mention of any unresolved security risk.
